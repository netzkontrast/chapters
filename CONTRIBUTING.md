# Contributing to Chapters

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Chapters.

Before writing code, it's important to understand what this project values.

## What We're Building

Chapters is a calm, book-inspired social platform built around reading, writing, and reflection.

It intentionally avoids feeds, virality, and attention-extractive design.

We optimize for:
- Clarity over cleverness
- Depth over speed
- Restraint over feature growth
- Reading as participation

## Who This Is For

Chapters welcomes writers, readers, and thinkers—people with inner lives, curious minds, and discernment.

You don't need to be a creator to belong here. Reading closely and thinking carefully are first-class forms of participation.

## How We Work

Good contributions:
- Reduce noise
- Simplify interactions
- Respect user attention
- Preserve the Book / Chapter metaphor
- Treat reading and thinking as equal to writing

We value thoughtful pull requests more than fast ones.

## What We're Not Building

Please don't propose features that:
- Introduce infinite scroll or urgency loops
- Gamify attention or popularity
- Add follower mechanics or trending systems
- Optimize for engagement metrics at the expense of calm
- Treat AI as a replacement for human voice

These ideas are out of scope by design.

## Muse AI Philosophy

Muse is a quiet companion, not a content generator.

It offers prompts, reflection, and support only when invited. It never replaces the human voice or auto-publishes on behalf of users.

Contributions that position AI as assistive, optional, and human-first are welcome. Contributions that treat AI as the main attraction are not.

## Expectations

- Keep changes small and legible
- Explain *why* a change exists, not just *what* it does
- Preserve tone and language consistency
- When unsure, choose less
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Read [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md) to understand the philosophy
- Review [docs/visuals.md](docs/visuals.md) for design guidelines

## Getting Started

1. Read [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md) for the complete philosophy
2. Check [docs/tasks.md](docs/tasks.md) for current status
3. Review [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) for architecture
4. Follow the setup guide in [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md)
5. Run the test suite to ensure everything works

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Write clear commit messages that explain intent
- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation when needed
- Respect the existing code style and patterns
